## Functionality
* User search cities and get current COVID-19 stats, main attractions, and weather forecast
* The search starts on landing page which has a search bar that autocompletes the city using Google API
* Once city is entered, the COVID Act Now, OpenWeather, and OpenTripMap API functions will call the information
* For the travel destinations, clicking on the pic will take you to a wiki-page providing additional details
* Using local storage, city search history is maintained for future use
