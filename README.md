# safe-travels

AS A traveler during a pandemic
I WANT a website that allows me to see current stats about Covid-19 in a city, city main attractions, and weather forecast
SO THAT I can be informed and travel safely

Given a website geared towards recalling covid and travel information for travelers
WHEN I visit the site I will have a landing page with a search bar that autocompletes the city using Google API
THEN I will have a search box that will all me to call information about a city's covid information, main attractions in the city, and weather forecast from three different APIs
WHEN I search covid information about a location
THEN I will have stats about current covid information returned from Covid Act Now API
WHEN I input a city into the search bar
THEN  main attraction information will be returned about the city from OpenTripMap API
WHEN I search information about a city
THEN the weather forecast will be returned from OpenWeather API
THEN I will plan my trip accordingly.
